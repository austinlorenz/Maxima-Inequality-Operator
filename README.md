# Maxima Inequality Operator
Maxima cannot deduce obvious facts which follow from the transitivity of the inequality operator.

(%i) assume(x > y)
(%o)                              [x > y]
(%i) assume(x > 1)
(%o)                              [x > 1]
(%i) is(x^2 > x)
(%o)                               true
(%i) is(x^2 > y)
(%o)                              unknown

I have created the operators '>>' and '<<' to overcome this weakness.  They work by creating a digraph G whose vertices are the variables in the expressions of the assume database related to the argument of the operator, with edges between elements if one is less than the other, followed by testing whether the first element is reachable from the second.

(%i22) x^2 >> y
(%o22)                               true

To see the graph generated by using the operators, enter dg(G).

(%i) dg(G);
(%o)                               done
